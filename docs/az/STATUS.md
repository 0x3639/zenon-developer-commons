Accelerator Z Proposal Status Update

I want to clarify the intent and current status of the Accelerator Z proposal associated with this repository.

The proposal was submitted in good faith and was not intended to signal completion, endorsement, or production readiness of the research contained here. The primary motivation was twofold:

	1.	To document and preserve a body of architectural research for the Zenon community in a public, auditable form.

	2.	To exercise and demonstrate Zenon’s on-chain Accelerator Z funding mechanism as a reference example for other researchers and developers considering similar submissions.

At this stage, given ongoing discussion and the need for broader independent review, I am not seeking to proceed with funding under the current proposal. If the protocol allows, I intend for the proposal to be withdrawn or revisited at a later time once the research has been fully digested, challenged, and validated by external reviewers.

Importantly:

	•	This repository exists independently of any grant outcome.

	•	No claims of implementation, endorsement, or authority are implied.

	•	Acceptance or rejection of the AZ proposal should not be interpreted as validation or invalidation of the research itself.

This work is exploratory and boundary-focused by design. It is meant to clarify what can and cannot be verified under constrained assumptions, not to prescribe a roadmap or request immediate execution.

If the AZ proposal cannot be formally withdrawn at this stage due to protocol constraints, this note should be treated as an explicit request to pause consideration and defer any funding decisions until a future revision.

Thank you to everyone who has read, questioned, criticized, and engaged. That process is the point.
