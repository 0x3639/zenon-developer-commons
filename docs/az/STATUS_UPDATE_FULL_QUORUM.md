AZ Proposal Status Update — Quorum Reached

Date: December 30, 2025
Proposal: AZ be968c…22f5f2 (full ID on-chain via Syrius AZ)

We would like to thank the Zenon community and participating Pillars for reaching quorum on our AZ proposal. We appreciate the engagement, discussion, and confidence shown through the voting process.

Although we requested that the proposal be retracted and resubmitted at a later date to reflect ongoing refinements, we acknowledge and respect the quorum outcome.

Work Completed in Good Faith

Before and during the proposal period, a substantial portion of the proposed work was completed and publicly released in good faith.

This work was delivered openly and without conditional gating, with the intent of strengthening shared understanding of Zenon’s design and long-term potential.

Payout Intent and Alignment

Given that quorum has been reached and meaningful milestones have already been completed and published, we intend to proceed with requesting payout for the work already delivered, consistent with the scope and spirit of the original proposal.

We want to be explicit about our intent:

	•	This request is not motivated by short-term liquidity or immediate selling

	•	We view Zenon as a long-term, high-conviction network and want to be part of the revolution

	•	The payout represents compensation for completed research and a means to maintain a sustained stake and alignment with the ecosystem

Our goal is continued participation and contribution—not exit.

Ongoing Research and Responsibility

Research will continue to be published transparently and responsibly. Where new findings refine or clarify earlier assumptions, those updates will be documented clearly and forward-looking, without retroactive distortion of prior work.

Future efforts will be scoped and proposed independently where appropriate.

Commitment

This work remains guided by the same principles that motivated the proposal:

	•	Technical rigor over narrative
	•	Explicit guarantees and limitations
	•	Openness to correction and refinement
	•	Respect for community review and governance

We appreciate the trust placed in us and remain committed to contributing durable, verifiable research to the Zenon ecosystem.
