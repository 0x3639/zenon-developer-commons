Governance Without Global Consensus

Status

Draft / Notes
Non-normative
Builds on: Incentives Under Partial Verification

⸻

Premise

In a bounded-verification system:

	•	there is no single canonical truth
	•	verifiers may disagree
	•	disagreement may persist indefinitely

Governance must function despite this, not in spite of it.

⸻

Core Constraint

Governance decisions cannot rely on:

	•	global state agreement
	•	full historical visibility
	•	synchronized participation

Any governance model assuming these properties is invalid at the edge.

⸻

What Governance Actually Means Here

Governance is not:

	•	deciding truth
	•	enforcing correctness
	•	selecting a canonical history

Governance is:

	•	coordinating behavior under uncertainty
	•	defining acceptable refusal
	•	managing evolution without coercion

⸻

Local Legitimacy

A governance decision is legitimate only within a verifier’s context.

Legitimacy requires:

	•	verifiable inputs
	•	explicit assumptions
	•	bounded scope

There is no universal legitimacy.

⸻

Proposal Visibility

A governance proposal may be:

	•	visible to some verifiers
	•	invisible to others
	•	visible at different times

Therefore:

	•	participation is optional
	•	absence is not opposition
	•	silence carries no semantic meaning

⸻

Voting Under Partial Knowledge

Votes are valid only if:

	•	the voting statement is verifiable
	•	the voter’s identity is verifiable (within context)
	•	the vote references a known proposal state

Votes outside the frontier are undefined.

⸻

No Absolute Quorum

Quorum cannot be global.

Instead:

	•	quorum is contextual
	•	quorum depends on the verifier’s observed participation set
	•	quorum thresholds must be conservative

Failure to reach quorum is not failure of governance.

⸻

Fork-Tolerant Governance

Different verifier groups may:

	•	accept different governance outcomes
	•	diverge temporarily or permanently
	•	reconcile later or never

This is allowed.

Governance must be fork-tolerant by design.

⸻

Governance Outcomes as Suggestions

Governance outputs are:

	•	recommendations
	•	policy signals
	•	coordination hints

They are not mandates.

Execution remains voluntary and verifiable.

⸻

Enforcement Limitations

Governance cannot:

	•	force execution
	•	punish unverifiable dissent
	•	override verification constraints

Any attempt to do so violates system safety.

⸻

Refusal Is a First-Class Action

Participants may refuse governance outcomes if:

	•	proofs are missing
	•	assumptions are unacceptable
	•	context differs

Refusal requires no justification.

⸻

Upgrade Coordination

Protocol upgrades must:

	•	be opt-in
	•	be verifiable
	•	allow coexistence with prior versions

Forced upgrades are incompatible with bounded verification.

⸻

Identity and Governance

Identity systems may assist governance, but:

	•	identity does not grant authority
	•	reputation is contextual
	•	historical trust does not imply future correctness

Governance authority is never absolute.

⸻

Offline Governance Participation

Offline participants may:
	•	miss votes
	•	rejoin later
	•	accept or reject past outcomes

Governance must tolerate delayed participation.

⸻

Failure Modes

Governance fails when it assumes:
	•	universal awareness
	•	enforced compliance
	•	singular truth

These assumptions are invalid in this model.

⸻

Design Principle

Governance should aim to:

	•	minimize harm from disagreement
	•	allow peaceful divergence
	•	enable gradual convergence

Not consensus at all costs.

⸻

Boundary Statement

There is no such thing as “correct governance” under bounded verification.

There are only acceptable coordination outcomes.
